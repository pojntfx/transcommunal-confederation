# The Transcommunal Confederation

These are the flags of the communes which are part of the Transcommunal Confederation. The Confederation itself has two flags; a simple one which is made up of a golden star on a red background as well as a more distinct, complex alternative flag that intends to symbolize the progress which is gained by the high efficiency and effectiveness of decentralized/distributed planning of the communes.
