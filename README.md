# The Transcommunal Confederation

These are some flags I made for the Transcommunal Confederation, a fictional, decentralized/distributed confederation of autonomous communes modeled after the [Rojava Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_North_and_East_Syria). There are the flags of the communes which are part of the Transcommunal Confederation as well as the flag of the Confederation itself.

The blue background of the primary flag of the Transcommunal Confederation symbolizes the vast oceans with the "enlightened" communes on the continents in gold. The olive branches are from the UN flag and symbolize peace; the five stars stand for the five traditional continents and the sun rays are meant to represent progress.

The green background of this variant flag of the Transcommunal Confederation symbolizes rehabilitated nature through dialectic naturalism as well as the characteristics from above.

There are also some simple communal flags (more like cantons, but hey) modeled after the Catalonian "Estelada" for some European regions (as well as Rojava, of course). Take a look at all the flags [here](./dist) and if you want to contribute, consider checking out [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/)!
